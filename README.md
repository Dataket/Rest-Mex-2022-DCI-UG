## Abstract.

We participated in the sentiment analysis track, classifying tourism reviews into two domains: the polarity measured by the number of stars assigned in the review (from 1 to 5) and the type of attraction being reviewed (namely Hotel, Restaurant, or Attractive).
For doing this, the conference organizers provided us with a labeled data-set. Given that the data-set was imbalanced, we extracted data from the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) to balance the data-set and performed translation from English to Spanish.

We used a pre-trained BERT model for the polarity sub-task ([_nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment_](https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment)), and we fine tuned the model on the data. Our model excelled in classifying the low stars reviews (1 and 2) because of the data augmentation for balancing. We used a bag-of-words model with a classification head using different machine learning algorithms for the attraction type sub-task. We obtained good results in this sub-task while keeping the computational cost lower than if we were using a BERT-based model for this sub-task.
